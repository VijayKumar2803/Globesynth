Globesynth

 Our project aims to develop an innovative platform that 
leverages advanced natural language processing and deep  
learning techniques to transform press releases into 
engaging multimedia content.

This platform will take press releases as input, translate 
them into any of the 14 supported languages, and then 
generate compelling videos using key points extracted from 
the text, combined with deep fake models and audio 
translations achieved from various APIs.
